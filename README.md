# Clean-Python-Code-Notes
While going over an Udemy course titled "Python Best Practices: Learn to Write Clean Python Code" I've decided to prepare clear notes allowing me to memorize all rules and practises. 

Topics covered: 

1) Variable naming best practises.
2) Indentation rules and best practises.
3) Blank lines rules and practises.
4) Whitespace best practises.
